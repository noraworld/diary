Today was the day I dispatched my monitor to be disposed of. My monitor was supposed to be picked up. But unfortunately, I was refused because I didn't have the stand, which is the foundation that underpins the monitor itself. In Mercari, I seem to have to put the stand together with its monitor, but I got rid of it several years ago. So I'm in trouble right now. Mercari is supposed to send me a message about what I should do next, so I'm in a situation where I've got to wait.
