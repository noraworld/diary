# Upgrading my iPhone & Apple Watch
Yesterday, I upgraded to iOS 16, which is the latest version at this time. And I also upgraded to watchOS 9 today.

I didn't plan to upgrade, but my iPhone periodically told me to, and my Apple Watch had the tiny problem that it didn't show icons for some apps. So I decided to upgrade. The problem still exists, though.
