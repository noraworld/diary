# What I have to tell the tutor that I'm having trouble with my network
This is just a memo.

I will have to say the following if there are any problems when I take a lesson during network Focus time:

```
I'm sorry I'm late. I've been encountering network issues.

It would be great if you could wait a moment while I fix the problems.

If the problems still persist, even if it takes 10 minutes, I will have to postpone our lesson.

I'm terribly sorry for your inconvenience.
```



# Organizing, discarding
I was organizing stuff in an accessory case. I would've thought that I would have completely disposed of all of the paper a while ago, but I actually didn't. There were some left in the accessory case, so I got rid of it today.

And I also discarded joint mats that I had put on the floor before moving. I thought about selling them but decided not to because there was a lot of dust and hair on them and I would struggle to remove it all. I thought I would rather throw them away than go through all that trouble.
