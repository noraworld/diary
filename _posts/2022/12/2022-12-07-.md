# Awful Environment, Again and Again and Again
Today was an awful day.

I woke up once at 8 a.m. with a weird noise. A renovation in this apartment began a few weeks ago. The noise I heard this morning must have been that noise. I thought it made some noise ever since it began, but today's noise was the worst I've ever experienced at this apartment.

I heard there was going to be renovation work a few days ago, but I didn't expect it to be this bad.

It's likely to last about three months. It'll be over at the end of February. I'm not sure whether I can put up with it until it ends.

I moved last month because the previous house was too noisy, but I still can't escape from it. It's really driving me nuts.

I started to put in ear plugs to reduce the noise I can hear, though they hadn't been used for a long time.

# Still Unusable Water Purifiers
Water purifiers arrived today. After ordering, it took a bit of time to arrive. I tried to install it in a tap right away, but I needed additional parts. I'll have to wait further, even though I'd already been kept waiting for a while until I received the body. That sucks.

I've already ordered additional parts. It'll arrive in a week.
