# Standing while working
I've been standing while doing some stuff like working or writing the code, or sometimes even watching videos.

The reason why I decided to work standing, even though I hadn't done that for a long time, is because one of my colleagues told me that he bought a new standing desk and he's using it to work standing. The second reason is because I recently watched Seto's video that explains the standing desk as sponsored content (by the way, I also have the same one).

I still have a bit of difficulty working while standing, but I also watched Mentalist DaiGo's video, which explains that the phenomenon of standing being tiring occurs even if it is for a short period of time because you are simply not used to it. So I think I need to do that for a while if I want to get used to it.

I try not to use the chair (I put it a bit far away from my desk), and if I find out that it's no longer necessary, I'm planning to dispose of it. For now, I'm going to continue to work standing for another month.
