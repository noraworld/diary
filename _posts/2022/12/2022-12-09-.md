# That Noise Disturbed My Sleep Once Again
The renovation work obliges me to suffer from sleep deprivation. So I didn't sleep well last night either. I went to bed with ear plugs in last night, but the renovation work's noise still disturbed my sleep. I woke up once with the noisy sound, and I slept again with an alpha wave playing with my headphones. I need to think more seriously about my sleep quality.

# The First Lesson Was Cancelled
I was supposed to take the first lesson with Mari, but unfortunately, she cancelled our lesson at the last minute. So I took a lesson with Ank instead.

# Listening Enhancement with Netflix
I started to watch the anime called Romantic Killer a few days ago. It's a Netflix anime series. It's not particularly interesting, but it's a good way to improve my listening skills.

The reason why I prefer watching Netflix anime series is because they have two original subtitles, Japanese and English, and can show them simultaneously.

At first, I watch it without the subtitles and try to listen to what the characters say and understand what the line means. When I can't do that, even if I listen over and over again, I turn on the subtitles and see the line and the meaning. That's how I plan to enhance my listening skills.
