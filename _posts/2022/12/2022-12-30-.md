My back hurts for some reason. The reason is that I've been organizing the data on my old computer recently, and I've been sitting all day.

I haven't been playing video games recently, and my Nintendo Switch Online was about to expire. So I was thinking about whether I should keep it or not. But a couple of days ago, I played all the games I have for the first time in a while, and I felt some games were exciting. So I decided to continue the contract. And I also think I want to play an online game with you. This is how I sent the message a few days ago.
