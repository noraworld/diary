I received protein ￼powder and plastic bowl.￼ in line with protein powder. It was a scheduled delivery so I think￼ it was a great time ￼to order plastic bowl this time.￼

Yesterday I talked to the British guy￼ on Cambly.￼￼￼ It was the first time for me to talk with a British guy, and I was surprised that I couldn't catch what he said, so I have get used to listening to not only an American accent, but also a British accent.

I didn't sleep well today. My brain doesn't function properly a few hours after￼ I woke up.

The renovation work is still in progress and I've been stayed up late recently, so I started to put the earplugs again.￼￼
