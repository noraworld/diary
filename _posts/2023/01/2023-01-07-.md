The renovation work on my apartment has begun again. On top of that, the sound became more noisy than before. That's so frustrating. My desire to go abroad became even stronger. Japan is so noisy, loud, and deafening.

I decided not to write "title" on a YAML header on this diary because it's too much hassle to do that every time. I want to focus on writing a "diary."
